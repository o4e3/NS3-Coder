The image displays a graphical representation of emitter counts versus time. The x-axis represents time, with values ranging from 0 to 1000 milliseconds. The y-axis represents emitter counts, with values ranging from 0 to 1000. The graph is red in color, indicating a negative relationship between emitter counts and time. The graph has a linear shape, suggesting a constant rate of emitter counts over time. The scale of the graph is logarithmic, with values increasing by a factor of 10 for each unit of time. The units of time are milliseconds, with values ranging from 0 to 1000. The units of emitter counts are also milliseconds, with values ranging from 0 to 1000. The graph is labeled with the units of time and emitter counts, making it easy to understand the relationship between the two variables.
