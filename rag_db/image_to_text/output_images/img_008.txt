The image depicts a graphical representation of Wi-Fi deauthentication rates over time. The x-axis represents time, with values ranging from 0 to 1000 milliseconds. The y-axis represents the deauthentication rate, with values ranging from 0 to 100%. The graph shows a steady decline in deauthentication rates over time, with a noticeable drop around the 500 millisecond mark. The graph's title reads "Wi-Fi Deauthentication Rates." The graph's scale is labeled "Distance (meters)" with values ranging from 0 to 100 meters. The graph's title reads "Wi-Fi Deauthentication Rates."
