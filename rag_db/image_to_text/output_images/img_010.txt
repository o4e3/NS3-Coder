The image depicts a graphical representation of a network packet with various parameters. The x-axis represents the time axis, while the y-axis represents the packet size in bytes. The plot shows the packet's size over time, with a clear peak at around 1440 bytes. The plot also includes two error bars, one on the left side and one on the right side, indicating the range of values for the packet size. The error bars are positioned at -10% and 10% of the peak value, which is around 1440 bytes. The plot is labeled with "2-plot with error bars" and "2-plot with error bars 2-2 plot with error bars" at the top and bottom edges, respectively. The plot's background is black, and the foreground is white. The plot's scale is indicated by the labels "x" and "y" at the top left corner and bottom left corner, respectively. The plot's origin is at (0,0) with the x-axis starting at 0 and the y-axis starting at 0. The plot's title is "2-plot with error bars" at the top edge. The plot's axis labels are "x" and "y" at the top left corner and bottom left corner, respectively. The plot's units are "bytes" for both the x-axis and y-axis. The plot's background is black, and the foreground is white. The plot's origin is at (0,0) with the x-axis starting at 0 and the y-axis starting at 0.
