The image displays a graphical representation of a network protocol stack. The stack consists of multiple layers, each with its own set of functions and protocols. The layers are organized from the bottom up, with the lowest layer being the physical layer, followed by the data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer.
 The physical layer is responsible for transmitting raw bit streams over a physical medium, such as copper or fiber optics. The data link layer deals with the transmission of data frames over a physical medium, ensuring reliable transmission and error detection. The network layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks, while the transport layer ensures reliable delivery of data between endpoints. The application layer provides services to end-user applications, such as email, web browsing, and file transfer.
 The graphical representation is color-coded, with each layer represented by a different color. The physical layer is depicted in shades of red, the data link layer in yellow, the network layer in green, the transport layer in blue, and the application layer in purple. The layers are labeled with their respective layer numbers, with the lowest layer numbered 1 and the highest layer numbered 5. The graphical representation is presented on a white background with black text labels.
