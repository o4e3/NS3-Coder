The image displays a web page with a blue background and white text. The page features a list of recent projects with their respective titles and descriptions. The projects are organized into three sections: "New Project," "Project Manager," and "Recent Projects." Each section has a subheading with a different color: blue for "New Project," green for "Project Manager," and red for "Recent Projects."
 The text is arranged in a table format with each project's title and description in separate rows. The table is divided into three sections with a horizontal line separating them. The text is aligned to the left with a small margin on the right side. The table is surrounded by a white border with a thin line on the top and bottom edges. The overall design of the page is clean and organized, with a focus on the content of the projects.
