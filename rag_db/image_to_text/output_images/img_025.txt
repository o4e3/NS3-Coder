The image displays a graphical representation of a network with a focus on the physical layer. The graph shows the bandwidth utilization over time, with a blue line indicating the average bandwidth utilization and a red line showing the maximum bandwidth utilization. The graph is labeled with units of "bits per second" (bps) and "percentage".
 The x-axis represents time, with the time scale ranging from 0 to 100 seconds. The y-axis represents the bandwidth utilization, with the scale ranging from 0 to 100%. The graph is accompanied by a legend explaining the different colors and lines used in the graph. The legend is located at the bottom of the graph. The graph is displayed on a webpage with a title "Effective Physical Core Utilization" and a subtitle "25% of 100%". The webpage also has a search bar at the top left corner.
