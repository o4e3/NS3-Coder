The image displays a graphical user interface (GUI) with a blue background. The GUI is designed for analyzing network traffic, specifically for the NetScaler 3000 device. The main focus of the GUI is a table with multiple rows and columns filled with numerical data. The table is organized with the leftmost column displaying the time in milliseconds, followed by the number of packets received in the same time interval. The next column shows the number of bytes received during the same time interval. The subsequent columns display the number of packets and bytes sent during the same time interval.
 The table is accompanied by a toolbar at the top with various buttons and dropdown menus for navigating and configuring the GUI. The toolbar includes options for filtering the data displayed in the table, as well as buttons for exporting the data in different formats. The GUI also includes a status bar at the bottom with information about the device's current state and any errors or warnings that may have occurred.
