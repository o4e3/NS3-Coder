The image displays a graphical representation of a network protocol stack, with each layer represented by a different color. The stack consists of seven layers, each with a specific function within the network communication process.
 The layers are arranged from top to bottom, with each layer's color corresponding to its function:

1. Purple: Application Layer
2. Blue: Transport Layer
3. Green: Internet Layer
4. Yellow: Link Layer
5. Red: Network Layer
6. Orange: Data Link Layer
7. Black: Physical Layer

Each layer is labeled with its name, indicating the layer's function within the stack. The labels are arranged in a horizontal fashion, with each layer's name positioned above its corresponding color. The graphical representation provides a clear visualization of the network protocol stack and its components.
