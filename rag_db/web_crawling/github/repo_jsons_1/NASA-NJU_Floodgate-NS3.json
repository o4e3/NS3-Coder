  "readme": "# Floodgate NS-3 simulator\nThis is an NS-3 simulator for Floodgate. It is based on [the NS3 simulation of HPCC](https://github.com/alibaba-edu/High-Precision-Congestion-Control) which also includes the implementation of DCQCN, TIMELY, DCTCP, PFC, ECN and Broadcom shared buffer switch. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact us (wqingyue@qq.com or kxliu@smail.nju.edu.cn).\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Build\n`./waf -d optimized configure`\n\n`./waf build`\n\nPlease note if gcc version > 5, compilation will fail due to some ns3 code style.  If this what you encounter, please use:\n\n`CC='gcc-5' CXX='g++-5' ./waf configure`\n\n### Run\nThe direct command to run is:\n`./waf --run 'third mix/config-dcqcn.ini'`\n\n### Experiment config\n\nSee `mix/README.md` for detailed examples of experiment config. \n\n## Important Files\nThe core logic of Floodgate was written in following files:\n\n`point-to-point/model/switch-node.cc/h`: the node class for switch\n\n`point-to-point/model/switch-mmu.cc/h`: the mmu module of switch",
