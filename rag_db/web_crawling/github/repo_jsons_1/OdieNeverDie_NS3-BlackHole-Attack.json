  "readme": "# NS3-BlackHole-Attack\nNS3, 2 Types of BlackHole Attack Simulation\n\nWe use DSR routing protocol to emulate BlackHole Attack on Ad Hoc Network. Meanwhile, BlackHole Type 1 means all legitimate data packets are discarded by malicious BlackHole node, while type 2 BlackHole Node selectively discard some data packets(There is an existing path between malicious node and the destination node). You can set the value of 'isMalicious' to switch the type on your own scratch file. \n",
