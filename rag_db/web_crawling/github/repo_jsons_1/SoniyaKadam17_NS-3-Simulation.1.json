  "readme": "Submission materials:\n1. Generate a brief report following the report template in Canvas explaining:\na. For each task, the experimental setup: indicate which part of the code you have modified\nb. For each task, the results: comment and include a screenshot of the result of the\nsimulation and screenshots of the packet traces in Wireshark\nc. For each task, the conclusions: what did you learn?\n2. In your submission, include also your modified .cc files properly named.\nRemember: the laboratory assignments can be conducted either individually or in couples. If you want to\nwork in couples, please enroll in a Lab Assignment teams in Canvas. Then, only one of the team\nmembers will need to submit the assignment.\nTask 1 :\nModify the example seen in class, first.cc, to simulate the following network:\n\u2022 2 nodes\no 1 network interface at each node\n\u2022 Point-to-point link:\no Data Rate: 10 Mbps\no Delay: 2 ms\n\u2022 IP address assignment:\no 192.168.2.0/24\n\u2022 Application:\no UDP Echo Server on port 63\no Packet size: 256 bytes\n\u2022 Use the same values as in the example for the rest of the parameters\nCompile and run the simulation. Visualize the packet trace file with Wireshark. Confirm that everything\nworks as you would expect.\nTask 2 :\nStarting from second.cc in the Tutorials folder within your ns-3 installation, create and simulate a network\nwith the following architecture:\nFigure 1: Network infrastructure\nDetailed information:\n\u2022 The network contains:\no 3 nodes in the first shared bus operating under CSMA\no 3 nodes in the second shared bus operating under CSMA\no 2 nodes in the point-to-point link\n\u25aa Note that Nodes 2 and 3 in Figure 1 have two network interfaces, one for each\nlink to which they are connected\n\u2022 The applications running in the network are:\no UDP Echo Server at Node 1:\n\u25aa Listening on port 21\no UDP Echo Client at Node 5:\n\u25aa Sends 2 UDP Echo packets to the server at times 4s and 7s\n\u2022 Enable packet tracing only in Nodes 2 and 4.\nVerify that the network behavior is as expected, by capturing the packet traces and utilizing Wireshark to\nanalyze them.Node 1:\nUDP Echo Server\nPort 21\nNode 2 Node 3 Node 5:\nUDP Echo Client\nPoint-to-point link\nIP Block:192.168.3.0/24\nData Rate:10 Mbps\nPropagation Delay:2ms\nCSMA link\nIP Block:192.168.1.0/24\nData Rate:100 Mbps\nPropagation Delay:10us\nCSMA link\nIP Block:192.168.2.0/24\nData Rate:100 Mbps\nPropagation Delay:10us\nNode 4\nNode 0\n",
