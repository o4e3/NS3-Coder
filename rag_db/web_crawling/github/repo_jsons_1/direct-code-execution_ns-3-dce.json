For example, instead of using ns-3\u2019s implementation of a ping-like application, you can use the real ping application. You can also use the Linux networking stack in simulations.\n\n\nMore explanation available on:\nhttps://www.nsnam.org/about/projects/direct-code-execution/\n\nDocumentation\n===\n\nIn case you have a question, you should first refer to the documentation:\n\n* A manual is available at https://ns-3-dce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnd look for answers on the ns3 mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users.\n\nContribute\n===\nDevelopment is done on github and bugs should be filed at https://github.com/direct-code-execution/ns-3-dce/issues.\n\nThe mailing list used to discuss internals is the same as ns3's: https://groups.google.com/g/ns-developers\n\nLicense\n===\nDCE is available under the GPLv2 license. A copy is available in the repository.\n\n\n# Similar projects:\n\n- [Network Simulation Cradle](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Network_Simulation_Cradle_Integration) (Not maintained anymore)\n- [VMSimInt](http://eudl.eu/doi/10.4108/icst.simutools.2014.254623)\n\n",
