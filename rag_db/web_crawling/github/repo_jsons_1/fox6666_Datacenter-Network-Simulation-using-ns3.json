  "readme": "# Datacenter-Network-Simulation-using-ns3 \n\nThis is the project for the USTC course \uff1aAdvanced Computer Networking  \nproject 1\uff1a`Datacenter Network Simulation using ns3`\n\n## Objective\n  * Simulate a datacenter network using ns3.\n  * Experiment two traffic patterns.\n  * Examine the network.\n  * Improve the network.\n\n## topology\n<div align=center>\n    <img width=\"759\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://github.com/fox6666/Datacenter-Network-Simulation-using-ns3/blob/master/image/network.png\"       \"\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u56fe\"/>\n</div>\n\n## Description\n  * 8 servers: n1\\~8; 4 ToR switches: t1\\~4; 2 aggregation switches: a1\\~2; 1 core switch: c1\n  * The network is partitioned into two clusters\n  * The links connecting to c1 are PPP, or the other networks are Ethernets, the networks\u2019 capacities are shown on the topology graph.\n  * All the end-end delays on the networks are 500ns.\n  * IP address assignment is shown on the topology.\n  * All the switches behaves like OSPF routers.\n  \n## Traffic patterns\n * Pattern 1: inter-cluster traffic\n   * Each server communicates using TCP with another server that comes from different cluster\n     * For example, 1-5, 6-2, 3-7, 8-4\n * Pattern 2: many-to-one traffic\n   * Select one server as the sink, and all the other servers communicate to it\n * Simulate the two patterns separately, obtain the throughput that the network can achieve, and find out the network bottleneck, how to improve the network.\n\n",
