  "readme": "# NS-3 (version 3.23) Source Code for MRO Handover Failure Classification \nThe folder contains NS-3 simulations for Mobility Robustness Optimization in Small Cell Networks. I added three sample codes for MRO_ABC [1], 2Cell_Analysis[2], and 12Cells_Reinforcement Learning.\n\nTo install the software, you are recommended to avoid python binding and examples during the compling. Errors can happen since there may be conflicts between your current GCC versions. \n\nPlease enjoy your simulations. Unfortunately, I could not organize the source code well. Thus, if you find errors, please reach me at minhthang711@gmail.com\n\nPlease cite my papers if you find the source code helpful for your researches\n\n[1] M. T. Nguyen, S. Kwon and H.
