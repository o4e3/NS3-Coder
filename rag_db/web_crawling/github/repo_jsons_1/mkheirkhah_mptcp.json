  "readme": "# Multipath-TCP in ns-3\nWe have developed a model for Multipath-TCP (MPTCP) in ns-3, which\nconforms to RFC-6824 and closely follows the MPTCP Linux kernel design.\n\nA brief description of our model can be found in our recent short\npaper, which was presented at the WNS3-2014 workshop, with the\nfollowing link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07721\n\nOur implementation is atop ns3.19 and supports several path management\ntechniques (e.g. FullMesh and NdiffPorts) and congestion control\nalgorithms such as Linked Increases, Scalable TCP, Uncoupled TCP and\nFully Coupled.\n\nOur recent works on multipath TCP that have been built on top of this\ncode are as follows: \n* [MMPTCP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7524530)\n  (IEEE INFOCOM 2016) - </b>Best in Session Presentation Award</b>\n* [AMP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8816848) (IFIP Networking 2019) -\n  </b>Best Paper Candidate</b>\n\n# Installations\nWe have tested this code on Mac (with llvm-gcc42 and python 2.7.3-11)\nand several Linux distributions (e.g. Red Hat with gcc4.4.7 or\nUbuntu16.4 with gcc5.4.0).\n\n1. Clone the MPTCP's repository\n\n``` \ngit clone https://github.com/mkheirkhah/mptcp.git\n```\n\n2. Configure and build \n\n``` \nCXXFLAGS=\"-Wall\" ./waf configure build \n```\n\n3. Run a simulation\n\n``` \n./waf --run \"mptcp\"\n```\n\n# Simulations\n\nA simple simulation script is available [here](./scratch/).\n\n# Contact\n\n```\nMorteza Kheirkhah, University College London (UCL), m.kheirkhah@ucl.ac.uk\n```\n\n# How to reference this source code?\n\nIf you use this source code in part or entirely, please refer to it\nwith the following bibtex:\n\n```\n@article{kheirkhah2015multipath,\n  author  = {Kheirkhah, Morteza and Wakeman, Ian and Parisis, George},\n  title   = {{Multipath-TCP in ns-3}},\n  journal = {CoRR},\n  year    = {2015},\n  url     = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07721},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n}\n```\n\n\n",
