  "readme": "# ETSI DCC Access implementation for ns-3\n\nThis is a software module for the network simulator ns-3 that implements the DCC (Decentralized Congestion Control) Access protocol specified by ETSI in [TS 102 687 v1.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/102687/01.02.01_60/ts_102687v010201p.pdf). DCC controls the data traffic injected by each vehicle to the radio channel for ITS-G5. It makes use of Prioritization, Queuing and Flow Control. This module has been tested with ns-3.26 and ns-3.20, but can be easily integrated in other versions of ns-3. We plan to integrate it into the iTETRIS simulation platform, which is being updated and evolved in the [H2020 TransAID](https://www.transaid.eu/) research project.\n\nIn order to comply with our sponsor guidelines, we would appreciate if any publication using this software references the following publication:\n\n    Miguel Sepulcre, Jorge Mira, Gokulnath Thandavarayan, Javier Gozalvez,\n    \"Is Packet Dropping a Suitable Congestion Control Mechanism for Vehicular Networks?\", \n    Proc. IEEE 91st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2020-Spring), Antwerp, Belgium, 25-28 May 2020. \n\nWhat DCC parameters can be modified:\n\n    Algorithm: Reactive, Adaptive or NoDCC\n    CBR target: only for Adaptive approach\n    Queue length\n    Packet life time\n\nHow to install:\n\n    1.- Simply copy the \"dcc\" folder into your \"src\" folder.\n    2.- Configure and compile ns-3 following the normal procedure.\n    \nHow to run the example script available in the \"scratch\" folder:\n    \n    ./waf --run \"dcc-example --Algorithm=Reactive --simulationTime=20 --NumCars=200 --Speed=27\"\n",
