  "readme": "# mmWave ns-3 module #\n\nThis is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org \"ns-3 Website\") module for the simulation\nof 5G cellular networks operating at mmWaves. A description of this module can be found in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ \"mmwave paper\").\n\nMain features:\n\n* Support of a wide range of channel models, including the model based on 3GPP TR 38.901 for frequencies between 0.5 and 100 GHz. Ray tracing and measured traces can also be used.\n\n* Custom PHY and MAC classes supporting the 3GPP NR frame structure and numerologies.\n\n* Custom schedulers for supporting dynamic TDD formats\n\n* Carrier Aggregation at the MAC layer\n\n* Enhancements to the RLC layer with re-segmentation of packets for retransmissions\n\n* Dual Connectivity with LTE base stations, with fast secondary cell handover and channel tracking\n\n* Simulation of core network elements (with also the MME as a real node)\n\n## Installation\nThis repository contains a complete ns-3 installation with the addition of the mmwave module. \n\nUse these commands to download and build `ns3-mmwave`:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave.git\ncd ns3-mmwave\n./ns3 configure --disable-python --enable-examples && ./ns3 build\n```\n\n## Usage example\nYou can use the following command to run the `mmwave-simple-epc` example. \n```\n./ns3 run mmwave-simple-epc\n```\nOther examples are included in `src/mmwave/examples/`\n\n## Documentation\nThe documentation of this module is available at [this link](./src/mmwave/doc/mmwave-doc.md).\n\n## Related modules\n- MilliCar is an ns-3 module for the simulation of mmWave NR V2X networks.
