We are using a drop-tail queue at the link.\n\n\n### Simulation\nThere is a TCP agent at N0 which creates FTP traffic destined for N1. There are 5 CBR traffic agents of rate 300 Kbps each at N0 destined for N1.\nThe timing of the flows is as follows:\n\n * FTP starts at 0 sec and continues till the end of simulation\n * CBR1 starts at 200 ms and continues till end\n * CBR2 starts at 400 ms and continues till end\n * CBR3 starts at 600 ms and stops at 1200 ms\n * CBR4 starts at 800 ms and stops at 1400 ms\n * CBR5 starts at 1000 ms and stops at 1600 ms\n * Simulation runs for 1800 ms\n\n### Plots\n![Congestion Window vs Time](https://github.com/samj1912/ns3-sim/blob/master/plots/congestion.png)\n\n![Total Bytes vs Time](https://github.com/samj1912/ns3-sim/blob/master/plots/total_bytes.png)\n\n![Packet Drops vs Time](https://github.com/samj1912/ns3-sim/blob/master/plots/drops.png)\n",
