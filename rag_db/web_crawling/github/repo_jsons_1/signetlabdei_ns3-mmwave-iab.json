  "readme": "# IAB feature for the ns-3 mmWave module #\nIntegrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is a 3GPP Study Item on the possibility of using the same network equipment and resources for both access and backhaul.\n\nThis extension of the [ns-3 mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless-unipd/ns3-mmwave \"ns-3 mmWave repo\") adds wireless relaying capabilities to an ns-3 NetDevice, and the possibility of simulating in-band relaying at mmWave frequencies. This framework has been developed by the University of Padova as part of a project with InterDigital Communications. It is still a _work in progress_, and more functionalities will be added soon.\n\nPlease refer to [our paper](/ \"IAB\") for a complete description of the model.\n\n# Relevant papers on IAB #\n- [M.
