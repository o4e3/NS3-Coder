User simulations\nare expected to be written as simple programs that make\nuse of these ns-3 libraries.\n\nTo build the set of default libraries and the example\nprograms included in this package, you need to use the\ntool 'waf'. Detailed information on how to use waf is\nincluded in the file doc/build.txt\n\nHowever, the real quick and dirty way to get started is to\ntype the command\n```shell\n./waf configure --enable-examples\n```\n\nfollowed by\n\n```shell\n./waf\n```\n\nin the directory which contains this README file. The files\nbuilt will be copied in the build/ directory.\n\nThe current codebase is expected to build and run on the\nset of platforms listed in the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES)\nfile.\n\nOther platforms may or may not work: we welcome patches to\nimprove the portability of the code to these other platforms.\n\n## Running ns-3\n\nOn recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3 (with examples\nenabled), it should be easy to run the sample programs with the\nfollowing command, such as:\n\n```shell\n./waf --run simple-global-routing\n```\n\nThat program should generate a `simple-global-routing.tr` text\ntrace file and a set of `simple-global-routing-xx-xx.pcap` binary\npcap trace files, which can be read by `tcpdump -tt -r filename.pcap`\nThe program source can be found in the examples/routing directory.\n\n## Getting access to the ns-3 documentation\n\nOnce you have verified that your build of ns-3 works by running\nthe simple-point-to-point example as outlined in 3) above, it is\nquite likely that you will want to get started on reading\nsome ns-3 documentation.\n\nAll of that documentation should always be available from\nthe ns-3 website: https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/.\n\nThis documentation includes:\n\n  - a tutorial\n\n  - a reference manual\n\n  - models in the ns-3 model library\n\n  - a wiki for user-contributed tips: https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/\n\n  - API documentation generated using doxygen: this is\n    a reference manual, most likely not very well suited\n    as introductory text:\n    https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/index.html\n\n## Working with the development version of ns-3\n\nIf you want to download and use the development version of ns-3, you\nneed to use the tool `git`. A quick and dirty cheat sheet is included\nin the manual, but reading through the git\ntutorials found in the Internet is usually a good idea if you are not\nfamiliar with it.\n\nIf you have successfully installed git, you can get\na copy of the development version with the following command:\n```shell\ngit clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git\n```\n\nHowever, we recommend to follow the Gitlab guidelines for starters,\nthat includes creating a Gitlab account, forking the ns-3-dev project\nunder the new account's name, and then cloning the forked repository.\nYou can find more information in the [manual](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/working-with-git.html).\n",
