  "readme": "# Smartgrid Cosimulation Platform\nSmartgrid Cosimulation Platform is a project meant to couple together multiple simulators that are simulating different\nparts of a smartgrid to allow the study of dynamics in a complex multi-domain system. Currently, \n[NS-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) is being used to simulate network activity between nodes and\n[OpenDSS](https://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) is being used to simulate power flow. To \ncoordinate the different simulators, the [Mosaik co-simulation framework](https://mosaik.offis.de/) is being used.\n\nTapControl is a working example that can be used to observe the simulator at work. It uses the IEEE13 to simulate power \nflow and network activity between sensors and actors. Communication between nodes can be performed using TCP or UDP over\npoint to point or Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) links. \n\n## Requirements\n* This project is being developed on linux, it has been tested on the following:\n    * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n    * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n* The following python versions have been used to develop the co-simulator:\n    * 3.6.8\n    * 3.8.2\n* Hardware Requirements:\n    * 8.0 GB or more to build NS-3\n\nThe simulator might run on other operating systems and with other python versions, but this has not been tested.\n\n## Installation\n1. Create project directory\n    \n    ``` \n       > mkdir cosimul\n       > cd cosimul \n    ```\n\n2. Clone repository\n    ``` \n       > git clone https://github.com/sustainable-computing/co_sim_platform\n    ```\n\n3. Run Script\n    ``` \n       > cd co_sim_platform\n       > ./install.sh\n    ```\n\n## Components used:\n* [Mosaik co-simulation framework](https://mosaik.offis.de/)\n* [OpenDSS](https://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx)\n* [NS-3](https://www.nsnam.org/)\n\n## Acknowledgments\nAs a part of the University of Alberta Future Energy Systems (FES), this\nresearch was made possible in part thanks to funding from the Canada First\nResearch Excellence Fund (CFREF).\n\nAdvisors:\n* Dr. Ardakanian\n* Dr. Nikolaidis\n\nDevelopers:\n\n* Evandro de Souza\n* Amrinder S. Grewal\n* Talha Ibn Aziz\n\n### Citing the Co-simulation Platform\n```Bibtex\n@INPROCEEDINGS{9149212,  \nauthor={E. {de Souza} and O. {Ardakanian} and I. {Nikolaidis}},  \nbooktitle={ICC 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)},   \ntitle={A Co-simulation Platform for Evaluating Cyber Security and Control Applications in the Smart Grid},   \nyear={2020},\npages={1-7},}\n```\n\nLast Modification: 2021-11-23\n",
