If you would like to contribute to ns-3, please check\nthe [Contributing to ns-3](#contributing-to-ns-3) section below.\n\nThis README excerpts some details from a more extensive\ntutorial that is maintained at:\n<https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/latest/>\n\n## Building ns-3\n\nThe code for the framework and the default models provided\nby ns-3 is built as a set of libraries. User simulations\nare expected to be written as simple programs that make\nuse of these ns-3 libraries.\n\nTo build the set of default libraries and the example\nprograms included in this package, you need to use the\n`ns3` tool. This tool provides a Waf-like API to the\nunderlying CMake build manager.\nDetailed information on how to use `ns3` is included in the\n[quick start guide](doc/installation/source/quick-start.rst).\n\nBefore building ns-3, you must configure it.\nThis step allows the configuration of the build options,\nsuch as whether to enable the examples, tests and more.\n\nTo configure ns-3 with examples and tests enabled,\nrun the following command on the ns-3 main directory:\n\n```shell\n./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-tests\n```\n\nThen, build ns-3 by running the following command:\n\n```shell\n./ns3 build\n```\n\nBy default, the build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nThe current codebase is expected to build and run on the\nset of platforms listed in the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)\nfile.\n\nOther platforms may or may not work: we welcome patches to\nimprove the portability of the code to these other platforms.\n\n## Testing ns-3\n\nns-3 contains test suites to validate the models and detect regressions.\nTo run the test suite, run the following command on the ns-3 main directory:\n\n```shell\n./test.py\n```\n\nMore information about ns-3 tests is available in the\n[test framework](doc/manual/source/test-framework.rst) section of the manual.\n\n## Running ns-3\n\nOn recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3 (with examples\nenabled), it should be easy to run the sample programs with the\nfollowing command, such as:\n\n```shell\n./ns3 run simple-global-routing\n```\n\nThat program should generate a `simple-global-routing.tr` text\ntrace file and a set of `simple-global-routing-xx-xx.pcap` binary\nPCAP trace files, which can be read by `tcpdump -n -tt -r filename.pcap`.\nThe program source can be found in the `examples/routing` directory.\n\n## Running ns-3 from Python\n\nIf you do not plan to modify ns-3 upstream modules, you can get\na pre-built version of the ns-3 python bindings.\n\n```shell\npip install --user ns3\n```\n\nIf you do not have `pip`, check their documents\non [how to install it](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).\n\nAfter installing the `ns3` package, you can then create your simulation python script.\nBelow is a trivial demo script to get you started.\n\n```python\nfrom ns import ns\n\nns.LogComponentEnable(\"Simulator\", ns.LOG_LEVEL_ALL)\n\nns.Simulator.Stop(ns.Seconds(10))\nns.Simulator.Run()\nns.Simulator.Destroy()\n```\n\nThe simulation will take a while to start, while the bindings are loaded.\nThe script above will print the logging messages for the called commands.\n\nUse `help(ns)` to check the prototypes for all functions defined in the\nns3 namespace. To get more useful results, query specific classes of\ninterest and their functions e.g., `help(ns.Simulator)`.\n\nSmart pointers `Ptr<>` can be differentiated from objects by checking if\n`__deref__` is listed in `dir(variable)`. To dereference the pointer,\nuse `variable.__deref__()`.\n\nMost ns-3 simulations are written in C++ and the documentation is\noriented towards C++ users. The ns-3 tutorial programs (`first.cc`,\n`second.cc`, etc.) have Python equivalents, if you are looking for\nsome initial guidance on how to use the Python API. The Python\nAPI may not be as full-featured as the C++ API, and an API guide\nfor what C++ APIs are supported or not from Python do not currently exist.\nThe project is looking for additional Python maintainers to improve\nthe support for future Python users.\n\n## ns-3 Documentation\n\nOnce you have verified that your build of ns-3 works by running\nthe `simple-global-routing` example as outlined in the [running ns-3](#running-ns-3)\nsection, it is quite likely that you will want to get started on reading\nsome ns-3 documentation.\n\nAll of that documentation should always be available from\nthe ns-3 website: <https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/>.\n\nThis documentation includes:\n\n* a tutorial\n* a reference manual\n* models in the ns-3 model library\n* a wiki for user-contributed tips: <https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/>\n* API documentation generated using doxygen: this is\n  a reference manual, most likely not very well suited\n  as introductory text:\n  <https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/index.html>\n\n## Working with the Development Version of ns-3\n\nIf you want to download and use the development version of ns-3, you\nneed to use the tool `git`. A quick and dirty cheat sheet is included\nin the manual, but reading through the Git\ntutorials found in the Internet is usually a good idea if you are not\nfamiliar with it.\n\nIf you have successfully installed Git, you can get\na copy of the development version with the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git\n```\n\nHowever, we recommend to follow the GitLab guidelines for starters,\nthat includes creating a GitLab account, forking the ns-3-dev project\nunder the new account's name, and then cloning the forked repository.\nYou can find more information in the [manual](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/working-with-git.html).\n\n## Contributing to ns-3\n\nThe process of contributing to the ns-3 project varies with\nthe people involved, the amount of time they can invest\nand the type of model they want to work on, but the current\nprocess that the project tries to follow is described in the\n[contributing code](https://www.nsnam.org/developers/contributing-code/)\nwebsite and in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nIf you would like to report an issue, you can open a new issue in the\n[GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues).\nBefore creating a new issue, please check if the problem that you are facing\nwas already reported and contribute to the discussion, if necessary.\n\n## ns-3 App Store\n\nThe official [ns-3 App Store](https://apps.nsnam.org/) is a centralized directory\nlisting third-party modules for ns-3 available on the Internet.\n\nMore information on how to submit an ns-3 module to the ns-3 App Store is available\nin the [ns-3 App Store documentation](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/contributing/html/external.html).\n",
