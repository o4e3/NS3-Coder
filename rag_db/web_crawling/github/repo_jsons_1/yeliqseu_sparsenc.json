Random linear network coding (RLNC) [1] and several of its sparse variants are implemented. The library supports three catagories of sparse network codes (SNC): random codes, band codes and BATS-like codes [2].\n\nThe following decoders are implemented: \n\n- (sub)generation-by-(sub)generation (GG) decoder has a linear-time complexity but exhibits higher decoding-induced overhead.\n\n- overlap-aware (OA) decoder has optimized code overhead but exhibits higher complexity.\n\n- band (BD) and compact band (CBD) decoders that apply to band code only.\n\n- PP(perpetual) decoder applies to decode the window-wrapped codes only.\n\nThe library had been used for performance evaluation and comparison when authoring the following papers. If you find the lib useful, please cite the papers when appropriate.\n\n- Ye Li, J. Zhu and Z.

Sliding-window mode is not supported. \n\nA sliding-window implementation, also known as streaming coding, is available as a separate project at: https://github.com/yeliqseu/streamc, which implementes coding schemes proposed in\n\n- M.
