The network is partitioned into two clusters\n3. The links connecting to c1 are PPP, or the other networks are Ethernets, the networks\u2019 capacities are shown on the topology graph.\n4. All the end-end delays on the networks are 500ns.\n5. How the IP addresses are assigned can be found on the topology graph.\n6. All the switches behaves like OSPF routers.\n\nTraffic patterns\n1. Pattern 1: inter-cluster traffic\n    Each server communicates using TCP with another server that comes from different cluster\n      For example, 1-5, 6-2, 3-7, 8-4\n2. Pattern 2: many-to-one traffic\n    Select one server as the sink, and all the other servers communicate to it\n3. Simulate the two patterns separately, obtain the throughput that the network can achieve, and find out the network bottleneck, how to improve the network.\n\n",
