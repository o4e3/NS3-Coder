    "question": "Hello, I have been working to send machine learning model weights in an ad-hoc network using TCP connections. My code is based in Python and I am not using the ns3-ai module (in hindsight I might try this). I am facing issues sending the model weights across the network and would like help in doing this. My current script has issues sending the model weights due to their structure. The model outputs weights in a list of arrays: weights = (10, _) and indexing into the weights gives arrays of shapes like (32, _) and (16, 16, 32, 64). I have tried such things: * Sending the weights directly - errors: Cannot send list data type (needs to be serialized). Trying to serialize the weights directly leads to corruption. I tried using bytearray() to serialize the data. * Breaking up the weights for transmission (packetization) - scrambled: Given the ad-hoc structure, packets reach an ego node \"randomly,\" and when analyzing the packets at the server, the data is scrambled - wrong order. (I have a grid of 25 nodes and one of them is assigned to be a \"server,\" one an \"ego\" node, and the rest * Compression - errors: I tried using H5Py to compress the weights into a file for transmission. Using flush() and id.get_file_image() get the bytes of the file. This send the data but upon trying to view the contents of the file breaks due to synchronous file opening. If it helps, I can provide my current code. Thank you.",
    "answer": "Hi, I don't use ns-3 tru python, but I guess you have to convert your data structure into an array of bytes. However, it might be even more convenient for you to serialize your data into a json, as decoding will be more robust (eventually you'll compress the json). As a matter of fact, sending data between nodes involves a lot of problems, including byte orders, array sizes, floating point representations, and so on, which are solved either by defining a data representation mechanism, or by serializing the data into a common format - and then why not json, it's compact enough. "

    "question": "Hello fellow ns-3 developers, I'm currently working on an ns-3 simulation involving a mobile User Equipment (UE) moving through an environment with four 5G base stations (gNBs). The simulation includes UE mobility, 5G module configuration, IP address assignment, and handover between gNBs. I'm also tracking metrics such as latency and throughput. However, I'm encountering a persistent issue with introducing and observing packet loss. Despite applying an Error Model, the final statistics always show that all packets are received correctly, with no loss recorded. I would greatly appreciate any guidance from those with experience in this area. Here are some aspects I’ve been considering so far: Checking the received power at the UE. Verifying the threshold configured to determine an outage or packet loss. Evaluating link budget components (e.g., antenna gain settings). Ensuring the noise configuration (thermal noise and interference) is accurate. Understanding how interference from simultaneously transmitting terminals is modeled. Reviewing the multiple access technique in use. Any insights or suggestions—whether confirming or challenging these points—would be very helpful. I’m eager to understand what might be going wrong and how to correctly simulate packet loss in this scenario. Thank you in advance for your time and support! Best regards, foreigntresy",
    "answer": "Next version will be \"5g_ultimissima_versione.cc\" or what? For your own mental sanity I'd suggest to use a date versioning format (e.g., \"5g_250512.cc\") or a proper versioning system (git). The \"inverse date\" is to simplify the files ordering. Anyway, I'd place an explicit log into the code to check if the error model works as intended, it should be in nr-net-device.cc at line 225. Moreover, consider that the error rate is a Byte error rate (not a Bit error rate), just for the sake of the numbers. However, you should still see dropped packets - but only the ones *received* by the ueNetDevice.Get(0) - the other devices are unaffected, and packets sent by ueNetDevice.Get(0) are unaffected too. "

    "question": "Hi, I am trying to change default EDCA parameters in 802.11n. Would like to confirm a few things: EDCA is separate for uplink and downlink? E.g., setting the EDCA parameters for STA below would correspond to an uplink scenario? Config::Set(\"/NodeList/*/DeviceList/*/$ns3::WifiNetDevice/Mac/$ns3::StaWifiMac/VI_EdcaTxopN/MinCw\", UintegerValue(3)); And setting it for AP (like below) would correspond to a downlink scenario? Config::Set(\"/NodeList/*/DeviceList/*/$ns3::WifiNetDevice/Mac/$ns3::ApWifiMac/VI_EdcaTxopN/MinCw\", UintegerValue(3)); My second question is considering the downlink scenario, how would the AP know to apply the EDCA parameter I set for let's say voice users? Because when I set up the traffic, I use that using UDP Client Helper and I set parameters of UDP client helper to simulate video-like traffic: UdpClientHelper client(apInterface.GetAddress(0), port); client.SetAttribute(\"MaxPackets\", UintegerValue(10000)); client.SetAttribute(\"Interval\", TimeValue(MilliSeconds(5))); client.SetAttribute(\"PacketSize\", UintegerValue(1024)); ApplicationContainer clientApps; clientApps.Add(client.Install(wifiStaNodes)) This doesn't \"label\" the client as \"VIDEO\", so how would the AP apply the EDCA parameters I set to these STAs?",
    "answer": "@Ella: \"3-dev\" means that it's the development version, most likely downloaded from GitLab (but there's also a mirror on GitHub). However, this doesn't tell if it's a \"recent\" development version... one could have cloned the repo 2 years ago, and it would still say \"3-dev\"... The most reliable way is to look at the CHANGES.md file. Somewhere at the beginning you'll find a line like \"## Changes from ns-3.xx to ns-3-dev\". This will tell you how \"recent\" the repo is. If it says \"3.44 to ns-3-dev\", you're on a very recent release. Said so, upgrading a development version is fairly easy (if you used git to clone the repo). Just use \"git pull\" from the terminal and it will update. "

    "question": "Is it possible to change the band that is being used for Wi-Fi 802.11 to an unlicensed band. For example I want to it to work at 500 MHz and I'm using SpectrumWifiPhyHelper, when calling the AddChannel attribute using the channel I created and frequency range I'm getting an exception because of an invalid frequency range. can this be solved or if there are any other ways for conducting the simulation.",
    "answer": "I guess you're referring to the ISM radio bands when you're talking about \"an unlicensed band\". The WiFi standard (and the ns-3 models) are already using the ISM bands. If I remember right the ones the 2.4, and 6 GHz ones (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels). I'm not aware if there is a model for 802.11ah, which uses the 860/900 MHz channels. About using a different channel at a different frequency, you can not do it as easily as you think. Each frequency has its own specific adjustments in the standard, and you can't simply change the frequency as you want, because the MAC-level timers will simply fail (if you're lucky). "
